## Examining the impact of state-level restrictive regulations on abortions in the United States.

## Introduction

After the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overrule Roe v. Wade (1973) which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion services, abortion and reproductive rights will be dependent on each state's judgment starting June 2022 and it is expected that half of the states in the United States will outlaw abortions (Smith et al., 2022).

Before this, even though abortion was made legal, most states have implemented regulations promoting abortion scarcity and leading to barriers to care in recent decades (Wolfe & van der Meulen Rodgers, 2021). For instance, Texas' House Bill 2 and Louisiana law required all abortion providers to maintain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital (Arnold, 2022). It's crucial to highlight the more restrictive forms of laws commonly known as "Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers" (TRAP) Laws that put stringent and unnecessary requirements on abortion providers (Austin & Harper, 2018). In 2017, 89% of counties in the United States have no abortion providers within their borders. People were forced to travel more than 100 miles to receive abortion services as of 2018 in 27 cities (Smith et al., 2022).

Even while laws are widespread, few studies assessed the impact of such regulations on abortions and fertility. For instance, Ellertson (1997) found a decrease in the in-state abortion rate and delay in abortions when parental involvement laws took effect, which implies the increased odds of traveling out of state for abortions. Also, Addante et al. (2021) concluded that states with more restrictive abortions have higher maternal mortality than states with moderate or protective abortions from 1995 to 2017. Most articles evaluate policy effects from 2006 or earlier, possibly prior to the more recent surge in regulation enactment (Austin & Harper, 2018). Such scarcity of research is particularly noteworthy after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, which emphasized the importance of providing solid evidence on the impact of regulations restricting access to abortion care in light of contemporary policy shifts (Arnold, 2022).

At the same time, COVID-19's introduction into a climate of abortion restrictions has increased the difficulties that providers and communities already face (Wolfe & van der Meulen Rodgers, 2021). Our study sought to assess the difference in abortion access and rate before and during COVID-19 and examine the impact of abortion barriers on abortion and fertility outcomes. We hypothesize that increased barriers to care might result in a decrease in the in-state abortion rate and an increase in maternal mortality rate, but potentially an increase in traveling across state lines for abortion care.

## Data Collection

### Abortion rate and maternal mortality rate

The main source for abortion data is the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), which is a leading research and policy nonprofit organization  committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health starting in 1968. We collected abortion rate by state of occurrence, abortion rate by state of residence, and percentage of travelling out of states for abortion in 2020. AGI collects information by conducting a periodic survey of abortion providers, Abortion Provider Census, for each state beginning in 1973. With the number of abortions performed in each state (abortions by state of occurrence) as estimated from the survey, they reassigned abortions to patients' states of residency using information collected by state abortion reporting agencies.

Maternal mortality rate is collected from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based from the National Vital Statistics System. This dataset includes maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births from 2018 to 2020. Maternal deaths is defined to be deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.


### Abortion policy and care data

The source for state abortion policy is AGI, which was collected from the American Community Survey. States were scored based on whether they had policies in effect in any of six categories of abortion restrictions and any of six categories of measures that protect or expand abortion rights and access. Each state was given a score of 1 for every protective measure in effect and a score of -1 for every abortion restriction in effect. A state with a score of either positive or negative six has either all of the abortion restrictions or all of the protective measures in effect.

The dataset for abortion care is collected from the Abortion Facility Database Project, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), at University of California San Francisco. It mainly provides the number of women of reproductive age per facility, gestational limit, and median cost of abortion services from 2017 to 2021. Data is offered by publicly advertising abortion facilities across the United States.

Other risk factors, including education attainment and poverty, are collected from FRED Economic Data and United States Census Bureau respectively. The data about percentage of poverty of 2-year average (2019-2020) is based from Current Population Survey and 1960 to 2021 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC). Education attainment data including percentage of High School Graduate or Higher and Bachelor's Degree of Higher in 2020 is based from the American Community Survey.
